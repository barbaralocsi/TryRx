        // FileSystemWatcher's documentation says nothing about which thread
        // it raises events on (unless you use its SynchronizationObject,
        // which integrates well with Windows Forms, but is inconvenient for
        // us to use here) nor does it promise to wait until we've
        // finished handling one event before it delivers the next. The Mac,
        // Windows, and Linux implementations are all significantly different,
        // so it would be unwise to rely on anything not guaranteed by the
        // documentation. (As it happens, the Win32 implementation on .NET 7
        // does appear to wait until each event handler returns before
        // delivering the next event, so we probably would get way with
        // ignoring this issue. For now. On Windows. And actually the Linux
        // implementation dedicates a single thread to this job, but there's
        // a comment in the source code saying that this should probably
        // change - another reason to rely only on documented behaviour.)
        // So it's our problem to ensure we obey the rules of IObserver<T>.
        // First, we need to make sure that we only make one call at a time
        // into the observer. A more realistic example would use an Rx
        // IScheduler, but since we've not explained what those are yet,
        // we're just going to use lock with this object.
        object sync = new();

        // More subtly, the FileSystemWatcher documentation doesn't make it
        // clear whether we might continue to get a few more change events
        // after it has reported an error. Since there are no promises about
        // threads, it's possible that race conditions exist that would lead to
        // us trying to handle an event from a FileSystemWatcher after it has
        // reported an error. So we need to remember if we've already called
        // OnError to make sure we don't break the IObserver<T> rules in that
        // case.
